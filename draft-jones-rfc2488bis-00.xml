    <abstract>
      <t>IETF transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP and QUIC are designed to
      function correctly over any network path. This includes networks paths
      that utilise a satellite link or network. While transport protocols
      function, the characteristics of satellite networks can impact
      performance when using the defaults in standard mechanisms, due to the
      specific characteristics of these paths.</t>

      <t>For TCP, the satellite path characteristics are often hidden from
      transport protocol connections by the use of Performance Enhancing
      Proxies, this however restricts the deployment of new protocols and
      mechanisms to updates of proxies and in the case of encrypted protocols
      this enhancement is limited.</t>

      <t>This document describes the characterises of common satellite paths
      and the considerations required when implementing and deploying reliable
      transport protocols. It discusses available network mitigations and
      offers advice to designers and operators of protocols and satellite
      networks.</t>

    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Satellite communications (SATCOM) systems have long been used to
      support point-to-point links and specialised networks. The predominate
      current use is to support Internet Protocols. Typical example
      applications include: use as an access technology for remote locations,
      backup and rapid deployment of new services, transit networks, backhaul
      of various types of IP networks, and provision to mobile (maritime,
      aircraft, etc.). In most scenarios, the satellite IP network segment
      usually only forms one part of the end-to-end path used by the Internet
      transport protocol. This means that user traffic can experiences a path
      that includes satellite network combined with a wide variety of other
      network technologies (Ethernet, cable modems, WiFi, cellular, radio
      links, etc). Although a user can sometimes know the presence of a
      satellite service, a typical user does not deploy special software or
      applications because they expect a satellite network is being used. A
      user is often unaware of the technologies underpinning the links forming
      the network path.</t>

      <t>Satellite path characteristics have an effect on the operation of
      transport protocols, such as TCP, SCTP or QUIC. Transport Protocols
      performance can be effected by the magnitude and variability of the
      network delay. When transport protocols perform poorly the link
      utilization can be low. Techniques and recommendations have been made
      that cab improve the performance of transport protocols when the path
      includes as satellite network. </t>

      <t>For TCP, much of this advice and these techniques have been
      implemented in Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) that split the
      protocol at the transport layer. The use of PEPs slows the deployment of
      new transport protocols and mechanisms and their ubiquity has made it
      difficult for new protocol extensions to achieve comparable performance
      over satellite channels. Protocols with strong requirements on
      authentication and privacy such as QUIC are not able to be split using a
      PEP and mitigations must be instead implemented by the transport
      protocol.</t>

      <t>The end-to-end performance of an application using an Internet path
      can be impacted by the Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) of the links and
      network devices forming the path. For instance, the page load time for a
      complex page can be much larger when the path includes a satellite link.
      A significant contribution to this reduced performance arises from the
      initialisation and design of transport mechanisms. Although Congestion
      Control and Recovery mechanisms are designed for use across Internet
      paths, the initial design could not optimise for the wide diversity of
      path characteristics that can occur. This document therefore considers
      the specific implications of paths with a significant BDP.</t>

      <t>This document is divided as follows: Section 2 identifies common
      characteristics of a SATCOM network that can impact the operation of the
      transport protocols. Section 3 outlines two non-TCP mechanisms that
      enable TCP to more effectively utilize the available capacity. Section 4
      outlines TCP mechanisms defined by the IETF that may benefit satellite
      networks. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary of the features
      recomended for modern transports.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Satellite Characteristics">
      <t>There is an inherent delay in the delivery of a message over a
      satellite link due to the finite speed of light and the altitude of
      communications satellites.</t>

      <t>Many communications satellites are located at Geostationary Orbit
      (GSO) with an altitude of approximately 36,000 km [Sta94]. At this
      altitude the orbit period is the same as the Earth's rotation period.
      Therefore, each ground station is always able to "see" the orbiting
      satellite at the same position in the sky. The propagation time for a
      radio signal to travel twice that distance (corresponding to a ground
      station directly below the satellite) is 239.6 milliseconds (ms)
      [Mar78]. For ground stations at the edge of the view area of the
      satellite, the distance traveled is 2 x 41,756 km for a total
      propagation delay of 279.0 ms [Mar78]. These delays are for one ground
      station-to-satellite-to-ground station route (or "hop"). Therefore, the
      propagation delay for a message and the corresponding reply (one
      round-trip time or RTT) could be at least 558 ms. The RTT is not based
      solely on satellite propagation time. The RTT will be increased by other
      factors in the network, such as the transmission time and propagation
      time of other links in the network path and queueing delay in gateways.
      Furthermore, the satellite propagation delay will be longer if the link
      includes multiple hops or if inter-satellite links are used. As
      satellites become more complex and include on-board processing of
      signals, additional delay may be added.</t>

      <t>Other orbits are possible for use by communications satellites
      including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [Stu95] [Mon98] and Medium Earth Orbit
      (MEO) [Mar78]. The lower orbits require the use of constellations of
      satellites for constant coverage. In other words, as one satellite
      leaves the ground station's sight, another satellite appears on the
      horizon and the channel is switched to it. The propagation delay to a
      LEO orbit ranges from several milliseconds when communicating with a
      satellite directly overhead, to as much as 80 ms when the satellite is
      on the horizon. These systems are more likely to use inter-satellite
      links and have variable path delay depending on routing through the
      network.</t>

      <t>Satellite channels are dominated by two fundamental properties, as
      described below: </t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet Loss: The strength of a radio signal falls in proportion
          to the square of the distance traveled. For a satellite link the
          square of the distance traveled. For a satellite link the distance
          is large and so the signal becomes weak before reaching its
          destination. This results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Some
          frequencies are particularly susceptible to atmospheric effects such
          as rain attenuation. For mobile applications, satellite channels are
          especially susceptible to multi-path distortion and shadowing (e.g.,
          blockage by buildings). Typical bit error rates (BER) for a
          satellite link today are on the order of 1 error per 10 million bits
          (1 x 10^-7) or less frequent. Advanced error control coding (e.g.,
          Reed Solomon) can be added to existing satellite services and is
          currently being used by many services. Satellite error performance
          approaching fiber will become more common as advanced error control
          coding is used in new systems. However, many legacy satellite
          systems will continue to exhibit higher BER than newer satellite
          systems. TCP uses all packet drops as signals of network congestion
          and reduces its window size in an attempt to alleviate the
          congestion. In the absence of knowledge about why a packet was
          dropped (congestion or corruption), TCP must assume the drop was due
          to network congestion to avoid congestion collapse [Jac88] [FF98].
          Therefore, packets dropped due to corruption cause TCP to reduce the
          size of its sliding window, even though these packet drops do not
          signal congestion in the network.</t>

          <t>Bandwidth: The radio spectrum is a limited natural resource,
          hence there is a restricted amount of bandwidth available to
          satellite systems which is typically controlled by licenses. This
          scarcity makes it difficult to trade bandwidth to solve other design
          problems. Satellite-based radio repeaters are known as transponders.
          Traditional C band transponder bandwidth is typically 36 MHz to
          accommodate one color television channel (or 1200 voice channels).
          Ku band transponders are typically around 50 MHz. Furthermore, one
          satellite may carry a few dozen transponders. Not only is bandwidth
          limited by nature, but the allocations for commercial communications
          are limited by international agreements so that this scarce resource
          can be used fairly by many different communications
          applications.Typical carrier frequencies for current, point-
          to-point, commercial, satellite services are 6 GHz (uplink) and 4
          GHz (downlink), also known as C band, and 14/12 GHz (Ku band).
          Services also utilise higher bands, including 30/20 GHz (Ka band).
          </t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Satellite systems have several characteristics that differ from most
      terrestrial channels. These characteristics may degrade the performance
      of TCP. These characteristics include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Impact of delay on feedback: The propagation delay of some
          satellite channels (e.g., approximately 250 ms over a geosynchronous
          satellite) it may take The propagation delay of some satellite
          channels (e.g., approximately 250 ms over a geosynchronous
          satellite) may requirte more time for a sender to determine whether
          or not a packet has been successfully received at the final
          destination. This delay impacts interactive applications as well as
          loss recovery, congestion control, flow control, and other
          algorithms (see section 4).</t>

          <t>Large delay*bandwidth product: The delay*bandwidth product (DBP)
          defines the amount of data aprotocol should have "in flight" (data
          that has been transmitted, but not yet acknowledged) at any one time
          to fully utilize the available capacity. The delay used in this
          equation is the RTT and the bandwidth is the capacity of the
          bottleneck link in the network path. Because the delay in some
          satellite environments is large, protocols will need to keep a large
          number of packets "in flight" (that is, sent but not yet
          acknowledged).</t>

          <t>Variable Delays: In some satellite environments, such as some
          low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations, the propagation delay to and
          from the satellite varies over time. Whether or not this will have
          an impact on TCP performance is currently an open question.</t>

          <t>Intermittent connectivity: In non-GSO satellite orbit
          configurations, TCP connections must be transferred from one
          satellite to another or from one ground station to another from time
          to time. This handoff may cause packet loss if not properly
          performed.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Even for characteristics shared with terrestrial paths, the impact on
      a satellite link could be more and can be amplified by the path RTT. For
      example, paths using a satellite system can also exhibit a high
      loss-rate (e.g., a mobile user or a user behind a Wi-Fi link), where
      additional delay can impact transport mechanisms.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Satellite Systems">
      <t>Satellite communications systems have been deployed using many space
      orbits, including low earth orbit, medium earth orbits, geosynchronous
      orbits, elliptical orbits and more. This document considers the
      characteristics of all satellite networks with a focus on Geosynchronous
      Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite systems.</t>

      <section title="Impact of Radio Transmission">
        <t>Packets sent over radio channels need to be sent in frames that
        need to be allocated resources (bandwidth, power, time) for their
        transmission. </t>

        <t>t is common to consider the satellite network segment composed of a
        forward link and a return link. The two links can have different
        capacities and employ different technologies to carry the IP packets.
        On the forward link, the satellite gateway often uses all the
        available capacity, possibly with several carriers, to communicate
        with a set of remote terminals. A carrier is a single
        Time-Division-Multiplexing (TDM) channel that multiplexes packets
        addressed to specific terminals. On the return link, satellite
        resource is shared among the terminals. Two access methods can be
        distinguished: on-demand access or contention access. In the former, a
        terminal receives dedicated transmission resources (usually to send to
        the gateway). In the latter, some resources are reserved for
        contention access, where a set of terminals are allowed to compete to
        obtain transmission resource. Dedicated access, which is more common
        in currently deployed systems, can be through a Demand Assigned
        Multiple Access (DAMA) mechanism, while contention access techniques
        are usually based on Slotted Aloha (SA) and its numerous derivatives.
        More information on satellite links characteristics can be found in
        <xref target="RFC2488"></xref> <xref target="IJSCN17"></xref>.</t>

        <t>There are trade-offs in terms of overall system efficiency and
        performance observed by a user. Most systems incur delay to ensure
        overall system performance.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO)">
        <t>The characteristics of systems using Geosynchronous Earth Orbit
        (GEO) satellites differ from paths only using terrestrial links in
        their path characteristics: <list style="symbols">
            <t>A large propagation delay of at least 250ms one-way delay;</t>

            <t>Employ radio resource management (often using techniques
            similar to cellular mobile or DOCSIS cable networks, but differing
            to accommodate the satellite propagation delay);</t>

            <t>Links can be highly asymmetric (in terms of capacity, one-way
            delay and in their cost of operation).</t>
          </list>As an example. GEO systems use the DVB-S2 specifications
        [REF], published by the European Telecommunications Standards
        Institute (ETSI), where the key concept is to ensure both a good usage
        of the satellite resource and a Quasi Error Free (QEF) link. These
        systems typically monitor the link quality in real-time, with the help
        of known symbol sequences, included along with regular packets, which
        enable an estimation of the current signal-to-noise ratio. This
        estimation is then feedback allowing the transmitting link to adapt
        its coding rate and modulation to the actual transmission
        conditions.</t>

        tradeoffs in the way the signal is sent on the communictaions channel.
        These tradeoffs are not necessarily the same for all packets, and
        network traffic flows can be optimised by mapping these onto different
        types of lower layer treatment (packet queues, resource management
        requests, resource usage, and adpation to the channel using FEC, ARQ,
        etc). Many systems differentiate classes of traffic to mange these QoS
        tradeoffs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Split TCP">
        <t>High BDP networks commonly break the TCP end-to-end paradigm to
        adapt the transport protocol. Splitting a TCP connection allows
        adaptation for a specific use-case and to address the issues discussed
        in section XXX . Satellite communications commonly deploy Performance
        Enhancement Proxy (PEP) for compression, caching and TCP acceleration
        services <xref target="RFC3135"> </xref> . Their deployment can result
        in significant performance improvement (e.g., a 50% page load time
        reduction in a SATCOM use-case <xref target="ICCRG100"> </xref> .</t>

        <t><xref target="NCT13"> </xref> and <xref target="RFC3135"> </xref>
        describe the main functions of a SATCOM TCP split solution. For
        traffic originated at a gateway to an endpoint connected via a
        satellite terminal, the TCP split proxy intercepts TCP SYN packets,
        acting on behalf of the endpoint and adapts the sending rate to the
        SATCOM scenario. The split solution can specifically tune TCP
        parameters to the satellite link (latency, available capacity).</t>

        <t>When a proxy is used on each side of the satellite link, the
        transport protocol can be replace by a protocol other than TCP,
        optimized for the satellite link. This can be tuned using a priori
        information about the satellite system and/or by measuring the
        properties of the network segment that includes the satellite
        system.</t>

        <t>Split connections can also recover from packet loss that is local
        to the part of the connection on which the packet losses occur. This
        eliminates the need for end-to-end recovery of lost packets.</t>

        <t>One important advantage of a TCP split solution is that it does not
        require any end-to-end modification and is independent of both the
        client and server sides. This comes with a drawback: TCP splitters are
        often unable to track end-to-end improvements in protocol mechanisms
        (e.g., RACK, ECN, TCP Fast Open support). Methods configured in the
        split proxy usually continue to be used until a split solution is
        finally updated. This can delay/negate the benefit of any end-to-end
        improvements, contributing to ossification of the transport
        system.</t>

    <section title="Transport Protocol Mechanisms">
      <t>This section outlines transport protocol mechanisms that may be
      necessary in satellite or hybrid satellite/terrestrial networks to
      better utilize the available capacity of the link. These mechanisms may
      also be needed to fully utilize fast terrestrial channels. Furthermore,
      these mechanisms do not fundamentally hurt performance in a shared
      terrestrial network. Each of the following sections outlines one
      mechanism and why that mechanism may be needed.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Transport initialization: the 3-way handshake takes a longer time
          to complete, delaying the time to send data (several transport
          protocol exchanges may be needed, such as TLS);</t>

          <t>Size of windows required: to fully exploit the bottleneck
          capacity, a high BDP requires a larger number of in-flight
          packets;</t>

          <t>Reliability: packet loss detection and correction is slow (the
          performance of end-to-end retransmission is also impacted when using
          a high RTT path);</t>

          <t>Getting up to speed: many congestion control methods employ an
          exponential increase in the sending rate during slow start (for path
          capacity probing), a high RTT will increase the time to reach a
          specific rate;</t>

          <t>Asymmetry : when the links are asymmetric, for various reasons,
          the the return path may modify the rate and/timing of transport
          acknowledgment traffic, potentially changing behaviour (e.g.,
          limiting the forward sending rate).</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Getting up to speed">
        <t>QUIC has an advantage that the TLS and TCP negotiations can be
        completed during the transport connection handshake. This can reduce
        the time to transmit the first data. Results of <xref
        target="IJSCN19"> </xref> illustrate that it can still take many RTTs
        for a CC to increase the sending rate to fill the bottleneck capacity.
        The delay in getting up to speed can dominate performance for a path
        with a large RTT, and requires the congestion and flow controls to
        accommodate the impact of path delay.</t>

        <t>One relevant solution is tuning of the initial window described in

      <section title="Maximum Congestion Window">
        <t>The number of in-flight packets required to fill a bottleneck
        capacity, is dependent on the BDP. Default values of maximum windows
        may not be suitable for a SATCOM context.</t>

        <t>Such as presented in <xref target="PANRG105"> </xref> , only
        increasing the initial congestion window is not the only way that can
        improve QUIC performance in a SATCOM context: increasing maximum
        congestion windows can also result in much better performance. Other
        protocol mechanisms also need to be considered, such as flow control
        at the stream level in QUIC.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reliability">
        <t>Packet loss detection and loss repair will consume additional time
        on paths with a larger RTT. The RTT also determines the time needed by
        a server to react to a congestion event. Both can impact the user
        experience. For example, when a user uses a Wi-Fi link to access the
        Internet via SATCOM terminal.</t>

        <t>End-to-end packet Forward Error Correction offers an alternative to
        retransmission with different tradeoffs in terms of utilised capacity
        and repair capability.</t>

        <t>Network coding as proposed in <xref
        target="I-D.swett-nwcrg-coding-for-quic"> </xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.roca-nwcrg-rlc-fec-scheme-for-quic"> </xref> could help
        QUIC recover from link or congestion loss. Another approach could
        utilise QUIC tunnels <xref target="I-D.schinazi-masque"> </xref> to
        apply FEC to all or a part of the end-to-end path.</t>

        <t>The benefits of introducing FEC need to weighed against the
        additional capacity introduced by end-to-end FEC and the opportunity
        to use link-local ARQ and/or link-adaptive FEC. A transport
        connections can suffer link-related losses from a particular link
        (e.g., Wi-Fi), but also congestion loss (e.g. router buffer overflow
        in a satellite operator ground segment or along an Internet path).
        Mechanisms have been proposed in <xref
        target="I-D.ferrieux-hamchaoui-quic-lossbits"> </xref> , to identify
        congestion losses in the ground segment.</t>

      <section title="ACK Traffic Reduction">
        <t>Asymmetry in capacity (or in the way capacity is granted to a flow)
        can lead to cases where the transmission in one direction of
        communication is restricted by the transmission of the acknowledgment
        traffic flowing in the opposite direction. A network segment could
        present limitations in the volume of acknowledgment traffic (e.g.,
        limited available return path capacity) or in the number of
        acknowledgment packets (e.g., when a radio-resource management system
        has to track channel usage), or both.</t>

        <t>TCP Performance Implications of Network Path Asymmetry <xref
        target="RFC3449"> </xref> describes a range of mechanisms that have
        been used to mitigate the impact of path asymmetry, primarily
        targeting operation of TCP.</t>

        <t>Many mitigations have been deployed in satellite systems, often as
        a mechanism within a PEP. Despite their benefits over paths with high
        asymmetry, most mechanisms rely on being able to inspect and/or modify
        the transport layer header information of TCP ACK packets. This is not
        possible when the transport layer information is encrypted (e.g.,
        using an IP VPN).</t>

        <t>One simple mitigation is for the remote endpoint to send compound
        acknowledgments less frequently. A rate of one ACK every RTT/4 can
        significantly reduce this traffic. The QUIC transport specification
        may evolve to allow the ACK Ratio to be adjusted.</t>

    <section anchor="sec:discussion" title="Discussion">
      <t>Many of the issues identified for high BDP paths already exist when
      using an encrypted transport service over a path that employs encryption
      at the IP layer. This includes endpoints that utilise IPsec at the
      network layer, or use VPN technology over a satellite network segment.
      These uses are unable to benefit from enhancement within the satellite
      network segment, and often the user is unaware of the presence of the
      satellite link on their path, except through observing the impact it has
      on the performance they experience.</t>

      <t>One solution would be to provide PEP functions at the termination of
      the security association (e.g., in a VPN client). Another solution could
      be to fall-back to using TCP (possibly with TLS or similar methods being
      used on the transport payload). A different solution could be to deploy
      and maintain a bespoke protocol tailored to high BDP environments. In
      the future, we anticipate that fall-back to TCP will become less
      desirable, and methods that rely upon bespoke configurations or
      protocols will be unattractive. In parallel, new methods such as QUIC
      will become widely deployed. The opportunity therefore exists to ensure
      that the new generation of protocols offer acceptable performance over
      high BDP paths without requiring operating tuning or specific updates by
      users.</t>
